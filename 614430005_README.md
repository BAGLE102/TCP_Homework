# TCP Echo Client/Server (Linux) ‚Äî README

## 1. Overview  
This project implements a simple **TCP Echo Server and Client** using the C language under **POSIX/Linux**.  
- The **Server** listens on a specified TCP port, accepts incoming client connections, and **echoes back** each line of text received from the client.  
- The **Client** connects to the server, reads input lines from the user via **stdin**, sends them to the server, and prints the echoed responses.  

Both programs use low-level system calls (`read()`, `write()`, `socket()`, etc.) to ensure compatibility and reliability.

## 3. Build Instructions  
To compile both the server and client:  
```bash
make
```
To clean up compiled executables:  
```bash
make clean
```

**Compiler:** `gcc` (or `clang`)  
**C Standard:** `-std=c11`  

---

## 4. Run Instructions  

**Run the Server:**  
```bash
./tcp_server 5000
```
The server will start listening on port `5000` and display connection logs.

**Run the Client:**  
```bash
./tcp_client 127.0.0.1 5000
```
Then type a line and press **Enter** ‚Äî the server will echo it back.  
Press **Ctrl + D** to exit the client.

## 5. Implementation Details  

Key system calls and their purposes:  

| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)` | Creates a TCP socket (IPv4). |
| `setsockopt(..., SO_REUSEADDR, ...)` | Allows quick port rebinding after restart. |
| `bind()` | Binds the socket to `0.0.0.0:<port>`. |
| `listen()` | Marks the socket as a passive listening socket. |
| `accept()` | Waits for a client to connect, returns a new connected socket. |
| `connect()` | Client connects to server‚Äôs IP/port. |
| `read()` / `write()` | Handles data transmission at the byte-stream level. |
| `close()` | Closes socket and releases system resources. |

## 6. Example Execution  

**Server Output:**  
```
[SERVER] Listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
[SERVER] Connected: 127.0.0.1:52344
From Client : Hi
[SERVER] Client closed: 127.0.0.1:52344
```

**Client Output:**  
```
[CLIENT] Connected to 127.0.0.1:5000
Enter the string : Hi
From Server : Hi
[CLIENT] Input closed.
```
